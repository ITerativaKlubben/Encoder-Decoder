# Encoder-Decoder

Use the program in the command line, with the syntax 
  "python EncodeDecode.py -e .\exampleRead.txt .\exampleWrite.txt"
, Observe that exampleRead.txt and exampleWrite.txt are placeholder names, you should insert the name of your files with the file to be read from as the first of the two and the output file as the second.

If it doesn't work then dowload python from the windows store.

Lastly, -e is for encrypting, it can be substituted with -d for decrypting
